Hermes uses Figaro (https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro) to store credentials, so that they aren't pushed up to Github. Create an Application.yml file at the project's root to store your own credentials, for example:

TWITTER_DEVELOPMENT_KEY: abcxyz123
TWITTER_DEVELOPMENT_SECRET: abcxyz123
TWITTER_PRODUCTION_KEY: abcxyz123
TWITTER_PRODUCTION_SECRET: abcxyz123
APPLICATION_SECRET_TOKEN: abcxyz123

Check Figaro's documentation for Heroku usage, they have some easy stuff there.
