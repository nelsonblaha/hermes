to-do functions (calendar)
	postpone presentations so that they reoccur at a later date
	various kinds:
		tasks that cannot be started until a certain date
		tasks that can be called for early ("what can I get started on?")
		tasks that require x hours free time to complete (designate available time on calendar)
	allow modification of subject line (preserve old subject line intelligently)
