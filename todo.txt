20121214 was setting up an ajax link in inbox/show that causes the inbox to be refreshed via the MessageSource#check method

set up default inbox and rule for RSS-

remove traits

validate Message.unique to be unique within messages of its MessageSource

rule_owner_id and rule_owner_type remove 'rule' prefix

figure out how to keep from passing user into MessageSource.check, self.user isn't working in there

message expiration option on inbox

inbox select boxes, select all, dismiss selected

Twitter

IMAP

Reddit

Evernote

Some service like an online specto to track webpages in the absence of RSS

Public filters and easy search to find them
	similar to IFTTT public recipes
	example: google alert filter pre-created to find emails that are google alerts

client-inbox association (send to Glass, send to email, send to pocket, etc)
	don't allow client inboxes to be shared? shared inboxes offer complications, not sure which exactly yet

Google Reader import

validate feeds after adding

shared inboxes

contexts and api documentation

actions (send to other inbox and dismiss, for example)

resolve dismiss-system-wide and dismiss-on-this-device via boolean mark on presentation ("resolve" vs "dismiss")

sanitize rule logic so users can't eval anything nasty

add receipt time to traits_hash for filtering

extract sender context encoded into messages (example: sender location) 
	shortlink hidden away that leads to webpage explaining what the shortlink is for, explaining what hermes is.

to-do functions (calendar)
	postpone presentations so that they reoccur at a later date
	various kinds:
		tasks that cannot be started until a certain date
		tasks that can be called for early ("what can I get started on?")
		tasks that require x hours free time to complete (designate available time on calendar)
	allow modification of subject line (preserve old subject line intelligently)

gtalk? How can message presentation be made flexible enough to work for both gchat and email?

clients
	web
	Glass
	pebble
	Android
	iOS
	libnotify Ubuntu
	notification center mac (supplants iOS?)
	Google TV?
